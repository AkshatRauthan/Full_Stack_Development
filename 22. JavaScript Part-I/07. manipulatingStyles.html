    <h2>Creation And Development</h2>

    <p class="description">
        In 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stane Lee
        was casting for a new superhero idea. He said the ideo for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage
        demand for comic books and desire to create a character with whom teens could identofy. As with
        Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as a oppurtunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing
        in his comics. In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magzine crime fighter the 
        Spider as a great influence, and in a multitude of print ans video interviews, Lee stated he was furthur
        inspired by seeing a spider climb up a wall-adding in his autobiography that he has told that the story
        so often he has become unsure of wether or not this is true.
